# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Supervised Machine Learning

## Project Overview
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub (provided), a peer-to-peer lending services company, We oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, using a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, are compared to predict credit risk. Once finished, the performance of these models are evaluated followed by a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
